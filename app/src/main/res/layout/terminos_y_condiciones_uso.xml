PLEASE READ THIS TERMS OF USE AGREEMENT CAREFULLY. BY ACCESSING OR USING OUR SITES AND OUR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND ALL TERMS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL OF THESE TERMS, DO NOT ACCESS OR USE OUR SITES OR OUR SERVICES.
IF YOU BECOME A LIAISON SUBSCRIBER AND PAY BY CREDIT OR DEBIT CARD, YOUR SUBSCRIPTION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RENEW FOR CERTAIN PERIODS OF TIME IF YOU DO NOT CANCEL PRIOR TO THE END OF THE TERM.

If you have any questions or comments, you may contact LIAISON by writing to us at: help@goliaison.com
This Terms of Use Agreement (the ´Agreement´) is a legal agreement that governs our relationship with users and others that interact with Liaison, Inc. and our subsidiaries and affiliates (´Liaison,´ ´we,´ or ´us´) in connection with the use of Liaison websites (including www.goliaison.com) (the ´Sites´) and our Services (as defined below). Liaison currently makes services available through our Sites, applications, which include mobile applications and applications available on social networking sites and other platforms, and our downloadable products (the Sites, the applications, the downloadable products and all services provided by Liaison in connection therewith shall be referred to collectively as, the ´Services´). Liaison may offer additional services or products or modify or revise any of the Services at our discretion, and this Agreement will apply to all additional services or products and all modified or revised Services unless otherwise indicated. Liaison also reserves the right to cease offering any of the Services. You agree that Liaison shall not be liable to you or any third party for any modification, revision, suspension or discontinuance of any of the Services.
    Your use of certain Services may be subject to additional terms and conditions, and such terms and conditions will be either listed in this Agreement, or will be presented or accessible to you by Liaison when you sign up to use, or use, such Services (´Additional Terms´). All such Additional Terms are incorporated by reference into this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. This Agreement does not alter in any way the terms or conditions of any other agreement you may have with Liaison for products, services or otherwise.
    All visitors to our Sites, whether registered or not, are ´users´ of the Services for purposes of this Agreement. If you register for the Services by creating an account, you become a ´Member´.
    This Agreement and any policy or guideline of the Services may be modified by Liaison in its sole discretion at any time, with or without notice. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting the revisions to the Site, and you waive any right you may have to receive specific notice of such changes or modifications. Your continued use of the Services after the posting of changes or modifications will constitute your acceptance of such changes or modifications; therefore, you should frequently review this Agreement and all applicable terms and policies to understand the terms that apply to your use of the Services. If you do not agree to the amended terms, you must stop using the Services.
    ELECTRONIC RECORDS
    Because the Services are provided electronically, you must consent to Liaison's providing important information electronically if you wish to use the Services. You consent to being provided with this Agreement, notices, disclosures, information, policies and other materials in electronic form (collectively ´Electronic Records´), rather than in paper form. Your consent to receive Electronic Records applies to all notices, disclosures, documents, records or other materials of any kind that Liaison may be required to provide to you.
    Electronic Records will be provided on our Sites and Services or sent to the email address associated with your account. You may wish to print out all Electronic Records and keep them for your records. If you have any trouble printing out, downloading, and/or accessing any Electronic Records, you may contact us in writing at the email address provided above. In order for you to access and retain Electronic Records sent by Liaison, you must have the following hardware and software: a computer or other access device capable of reading html and text files, a modem or other means of accessing the Internet, a browser capable of accessing and displaying the Liaison website and the ability to receive and read emails. To print the Electronic Records, you will also need a printer.
    You may withdraw your consent to receive Electronic Records by contacting us in writing at the email address provided above. However, the Services provided by Liaison are only available if you agree to receive Electronic Records, and you understand that withdrawing such consent will result in your account being deactivated. You can obtain a paper copy of an Electronic Record by contacting us in writing at the email address provided above, provided that Liaison may charge a reasonable fee to cover the costs of printing and sending the requested Electronic Record.
